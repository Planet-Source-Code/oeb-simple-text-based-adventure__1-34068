### Description

This is a simple Text based game in its early stages. It is intended to be a cross between the old unix games Adventure and Rouge (basicly a Rouge with more discriptions (sp?).

It reads maps and events from ASCII text files so the maps etc are Easy to change. I have yet to add monsters, items or anything else and mabey in some release Imight try stringing together a random map generator. Hope you like it,
